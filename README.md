# OpenTriad

Welcome to Open Triad! This project is a reimplementation of the fabulous card game called "Triple Triad" originally developed by Square for the Playstation 1 title "Final Fantasy 8". 

OpenTriad is enterily build upon the android-platform - no 3rd-party libraries are required to build, deploy and run the project.

This project started out as a one-man weekend project so don't except a complete game, its just a proof-of-concept but I'd love to see a complete Triple Triad clone in the future.

If you're interested in contributing to this project you should take a look into CONTRIBUTOR-README file.
Contributors, pull requests or mere ideas are welcome - happy hacking!

## Features
 - Basic TripleTriad reimplementation
 - Userprofile-System
 - Score-System

## TODO
- Implement deck management (we don't need real decks, just selecting 5 'active' cards should be enough)
 - Implement the rest of the cards and a solution to switch between background colors (red = enemy card, blue = player card)
 - Implement animations / mimic UI of the original game
 - Implement original ruleset (like same, open, etc..)
 - Replace ripped content with open source / free to use content
 - Audio FX / Music
 - Implement multiplayer (bluetooth, wlan, maybe over internet?)

### Happy hacking!
