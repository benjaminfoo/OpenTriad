OpenTriad
=========

Welcome to Open Triad! This project is a reimplementation of the fabulous card game called "Triple Triad" originally developed by Square for the Playstation 1 game "Final Fantasy 8". 
It makes heavy use of the android platform and gradle, so no third-party libs are required - just checkout, build and deploy.
This project started out as a one-man weekend project so don't except a complete game, its just a proof-of-concept but I'd love to see a complete Triple Triad clone in the future.

If you're interested in contributing to this project you should take a look into CONTRIBUTOR-README file.
Contributors, pull requests or mere ideas are welcome - happy hacking!

Features
=========
 - Play triple triad against a bot who randomly sets card on the field

TODO
=========
 - Implement deck management
 - Implement the rest of the cards and a solution to switch between background colors (red = enemy card, blue = player card)
 - Implement animations / mimic UI of the original game
 - Implement original ruleset (like same, open, etc...)
 - Implement multiplayer (bluetooth, wlan, maybe over internet?)
 - Replace ripped content with open source / free to use content
 - Audio FX / Music

Happy hacking!
